`> npm install.`

## To run project

2. In terminal window: Build the code `> npm run build-prod`
4. In terminal window: Run the Dev Server `> npm run build-dev`; this will automatically pop open `http://localhost:8080`
5. Type a location in the location box, select dates of your trip and click on generate.
